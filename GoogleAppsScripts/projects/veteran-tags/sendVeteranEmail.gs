      <p>You are receiving this email because you met the attendance requirements to register as a veteran for the <b>${season} ${year} season of ${sport} - ${day} - ${division} Division</b>. In order to register during the veteran registration window, you <i>must</i> <a href='https://shopify.com/55475535966/account?locale=en&region_country=US' target='_blank'>Sign In to the BARS website</a> using this email address (you will typically get a code emailed or texted to you and use that to validate your sign in) - if you don't, you will not be able to add the Registration product to your cart. (If you haven't before, we recommend signing in <i>before</i> your registration period starts in case you have any trouble; we may not be able to help right at registration time.)</p>

      <p>Please note that veteran status does not guarantee your registration - you must register successfully during the Veteran Registration window in order to secure your spot.</p>
      
      <p>If you have any questions, please reach out to <a style='color:blue' href='mailto:${leadershipEmailAddress}'>${leadershipEmailAddress}</a></p>
