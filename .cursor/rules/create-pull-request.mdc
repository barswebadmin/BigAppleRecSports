description: use when user prompts to create a pull request
---

Before creating a pull request, run all tests that would be run by CI checks with `make test .` from project root, summarize failures briefly and suggest to user to fix, create without fixing, or escape

When creating a pull request, give a bullet points describing changes being merged into main:
- use markdown
- do not describe just one commits, or each commit individually. summarize all changes from the latest commit on the current branch (unless user specifically asks to start a new branch) vs origin/main.
- use sections for different groups of changes (refactor/reorganize vs feature vs fix)
- use bullet points within those sections. be descriptive, but brief.
- add notes at the end for any TODOs left or future changes/risks to address
