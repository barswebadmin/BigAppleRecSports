- **test method consolidation**: Prefer a single test function per feature with multiple cases looped; avoid many small, redundant tests.
- **test placement**: Prefer `tests/` directories adjacent to the file-under-test; only lift higher when necessary.
- **logging style**: Keep logs brief and focused only on values under test; include colorization and clear labels for expected and got.
- **verbosity defaults**: Default to verbose with logs in local runs; provide a quiet mode for CI (e.g., `make test-q`).
- **colorization**: Use ANSI colors for labels (e.g., cyan for "expected", yellow for "got"); show ✅/❌ symbols.
- **pytest plugins**: Prefer `pytest-rich` locally for improved readability; fall back to quiet mode in CI.- **test method consolidation**: Prefer a single test function per feature with multiple cases looped; avoid many small, redundant tests.
