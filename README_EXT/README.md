## üìñ Documentation Philosophy

- **Main README** - Complete overview, installation, API reference, troubleshooting
- **Extended docs** - Deep dives into specific topics (development, deployment, security)

- **Cross-linking** - All documents link to each other for easy navigation

This organization keeps documentation discoverable while preventing the main README from becoming overwhelming.
